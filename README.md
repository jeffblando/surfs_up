### Summary:

We can determine from the results that it is warmer in June than it is in December and there is less variability in the temperature in June than in December. 

Additionally, to gather more weather data for June and December, we could run a couple more queries. We could find out the variability between station locations and we could also perform a high level inquiry to look at the variability across each month to find out which specific location is best suited for the business.
